# **App Name**: PersonaForge

## Core Features:

- Persona Creation: Create and manage multiple character personas with distinct backstories, traits, and goals.
- Profile Picture Generation: Automatically generate a profile picture for the persona using AI tools. Input parameters should come from the character traits. This could use services such as stable diffusion or midjourney.
- User Details Customization: Personalize personas by adding details about the user, such as name and an "about me" section. Allow the use of URLs for the "about me" section.
- AI-Powered Chat: Utilize Gemini 2.5 Flash to engage in conversations with selected personas, maintaining character consistency. The LLM should reason about when/if it should incorporate various parts of the system prompt or available "tools" in its response.
- API Key Management: Provide options for users to input their own API keys for the AI model (Gemini 2.5 Flash), for maximum cost savings and customization.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vivid purple (#9D4EDD), evoking creativity and imagination.
- Background color: Dark gray (#212529), provides a sophisticated backdrop and ensures good contrast.
- Accent color: Electric blue (#48BFE3), used for highlights and interactive elements to draw attention.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif), giving a tech-forward and modern appearance.
- Body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif), for readability and a clean aesthetic.
- Use a consistent set of animated icons to represent character traits and settings. Focus on clean, modern, vector-based designs.
- Implement engaging and elaborate animations when transitioning between personas or when a persona is "speaking". Consider the use of parallax effects and subtle particle effects for a modern, cutting-edge look.
